# Light Commander

Midnight Commander-like POSIX TUI file browser that aims to take less than 1 KB of storage with a single executable, requiring no dependencies not present on any POSIX machine (making it 7000x lighter than MC). 

The name is likely temporary. Uploading before choosing the final bc I need some version control. Some other variants I was considering:

* Feather Commander
* Dusk Commander
  * `dc` is taken
* Twighlight Commander
  * `tc` is taken for Traffic Control
* Javier Commander
* xc
  * Sounds cool, but IDK what x should stand for
* zc
* Haiku Commander
  * Not taken `hc` shortcut
